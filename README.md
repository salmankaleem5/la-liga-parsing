# La Liga Teams and Results Extraction Script

### Description
This script parses [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017%E2%80%9318_La_Liga) to extract the names of all teams in La Liga and then saves the data locally in a JSON file. This was written for use with my [Soccer Fixtures project](https://github.com/salmankaleem5/soccer-fixtures-react), which is a online schedule for all matches in La Liga this 2017-2018 season.
